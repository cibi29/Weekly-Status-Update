# Weekly-Status-Update
This page will temporary reflect weekly updates on the project

## Week 1
* Read the Active Learning Survery by Burr Settles
* Read the following papers - 
1. [Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf)
2. [word2vec Parameter Learning Explained](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2738v3.pdf)
3. [Training Connectionist Networks with Queries and Selective Sampling](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/261-training-connectionist-networks-with-queries-and-selective-sampling.pdf)
* Word2vec was evaluated for different sizes of training dataset from 0.1 to the entire dataset. [Results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27007966/28961123-d26b81c4-791e-11e7-8313-b3e05f6be733.png)
* As expected, performance increases almost linearly with the size of the training dataset. 

## Week 2 (In Progress)
* Goal - Machine Translation from French to English to augment English dataset
* Pre-trained word embeddings have already been released recently by Facebook for over 290 languages
* FastText Word Embeddings for Arabic were trained on a corpus of
